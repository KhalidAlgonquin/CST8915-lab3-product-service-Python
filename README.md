# Product Service (Python)

This is a Python rewrite of the Lab 2 Rust `product-service` so it can be deployed to **Azure App Service**.

## Endpoints

- `GET /products` → returns a JSON array of products (same as the Rust service)
- `GET /health` → simple health check

## Run locally

Test:
- http://localhost:3030/products
